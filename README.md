# The Laundry Chronicles: The Case of the Vanishing Clothes

## Project Description

The project, _The Laundry Chronicles: The Case of the Vanishing Clothes_, is a short comedic film that explores the relatable trials and tribulations of college dorm life through the lens of a single, chaotic laundry day. The story follows a college student’s transformation from calm and collected to frantic and determined after forgetting her laundry in the college dorm’s laundry room.

The overall concept centers around the theme of everyday chaos, where a routine task unexpectedly turns into a lively adventure. The film captures a mix of suspense and lightheartedness, illustrating how small moments in daily life can quickly escalate but ultimately resolve with relief and satisfaction.

Our goal for this project was to craft a humorous and immersive experience by combining realistic settings with captivating cinematography. Through dynamic shots, close-ups, and playful pacing, the film captures the emotional ups and downs of the character’s journey, allowing the audience to easily relate to their situation.

## Process:

### Conceptualization and Storyboarding

First of all, we gathered together to brainstorm about the film for this project. In this phase, we agreed to work on a story about a specific location and what happens there. Aleks came up with the idea of making a film about a relatable and humorous experience happening in the laundry room with a little touch of suspense. Storyboarding played a crucial role in bringing the film to life, enabling meticulous planning of shot composition and camera angles. Each storyboard was crafted to highlight the character’s emotional journey.

### Shot Planning

Once we were done with conceptualization and storyboarding, we meticulously planned each shot. Shot planning focused on capturing the character’s emotional progression and ensuring a seamless flow between scenes. A mix of wide shots, medium shots, and close-ups were carefully selected to emphasize key moments, such as the calm beginning, the frantic search, and the relief of finding the lost laundry. Wide shots were used to establish the setting and the character's movements, while close-ups highlighted emotional details like panic, frustration, and eventual joy.

### Filming

With the storyboards and shot plans finalized, we began the filming process by setting up the designated locations – the laundry room, dorm hallway, and dorm lounge. The BlackMagic HD Pocket Camera was used to film the video. For each scene, various lenses from Lumix were selected to match the required framing and focus. Lighting was kept natural and consistent throughout the filming process, as the laundry room and dorm settings already provided a realistic and relatable atmosphere for the story.

The filming process was a collaborative effort, with team members taking on roles such as camera operation, sound recording, and acting. Aleks took charge of the camera operation, Sihyun took charge of sound recording, and Tiffany took charge of acting. The Zoom H5 recorder and Rode NTG3B shotgun mic were used to ensure clear audio, capturing key sounds.

Each shot was carefully reviewed after filming to ensure alignment with the storyboard and shot plan, paying close attention to framing, focus, and continuity. The team worked efficiently to manage the confined spaces of the laundry room and ensure that each scene felt seamless and engaging. This process allowed us to stay true to the original storyboard, resulting in a cohesive and visually appealing final product.

### Editing and Post-Production

For post-production and editing, we used Adobe Premiere Pro to begin by syncing the sound and video for each scene to ensure everything was perfectly aligned. Next, we stabilized the footage to eliminate any shakiness from the original recordings. During filming, we had envisioned incorporating various transitions, so we carefully edited to ensure these flowed seamlessly between scenes. A particular challenge arose with the scene where the washing machine lights up, we had filmed it on a continuous loop, so we trimmed and refined the footage to make the cuts invisible to the audience. Finally, we added music to enhance the overall cinematic feel, tying the visuals and audio together for a cohesive and engaging final product.

### Website Creation

When faced with the challenge of designing a website to house our final video, we decided to give the website a minimalist tone, with a color scheme similar to that found in the video and engaging interactive elements. Upon first interacting with the website, the user is greeted with a title screen and a few pieces of laundry around the screen. As the user scrolls down, the laundry is animated and falls, where the user is presented with an element to engage with. The pulsating light on the washing machine draws the viewers' attention, and upon hovering over the washing machine, the cursor indicates a clickable element, and the machine itself scales up. When clicked, the actual video appears on the screen, thus prompting the idea that the user must have already given some attention to the website actually to see the video. Additionally, a few more elements appear, such as the bloopers and about section, and a secret message at the end, which the user can scroll to learn more about how the film was made and what went on behind the scenes of production. Ultimately, the website ended up capturing the essence of our video very well.

## Reflection/Evaluation

The initial concept for this project was to create a short film that illustrates a story happening around the laundry room, and the final product successfully achieved this goal. Through meticulous planning, collaborative effort, and creative execution, the film captured the humor, suspense, and relatability of the narrative as envisioned during the brainstorming phase.
One of our primary goals was to depict the emotional highs and lows of a seemingly mundane experience, and the final film effectively conveyed this through dynamic shots and engaging pacing. The character's journey—from calm beginnings to frantic panic and eventual relief—was brought to life in a way that resonated with the audience. The seamless integration of the laundry room, hallway, and dorm lounge settings helped maintain a cohesive flow, ensuring that each scene transitioned naturally and supported the overall narrative.
While the project faced minor challenges, such as managing the limited space in the laundry room and coordinating the use of equipment, these obstacles were overcome through teamwork and adaptability. Additionally, due to the time constraints we were unable to implement a few elements that we wanted to include for the website, such as a nav bar after the video is available, but hope to refine in our future projects. Reflecting on the process, we found that our initial expectations were not only met but exceeded, as the final product retained the humor and relatability we aimed to achieve while adding a touch of charm and personality that made the story uniquely ours.
In the end, the project served as a valuable learning experience, allowing us to develop our skills in storyboarding, shot planning, and collaborative filmmaking. It demonstrated the importance of attention to detail and creative problem-solving, leaving us satisfied with the outcome and eager to take on future projects.

## Future Improvements

For future iterations, expanding the story could enhance its engagement and depth. Introducing additional characters might create opportunities for humorous or dramatic interactions, such as a roommate reminding the protagonist about their forgotten laundry or a fellow student disputing over misplaced items. We would also like to add more elements and interactivity to our website, for example a mini-game where the user has to sort clothes in a short amount of time or something of the sort.
